      <th>Gantt Chart</th>
      <td>To save some time I used a gantt chart from a past project and modified it.
          I devided my project into 4 main phases; plan, research, design and programming.
          In my plan phase I made my Gantt Chart, Kanban Board and Trello Board. In my research phase 
          I made my first sketches of the website and my Style Tile. In my design phase I made my 
          wireframe and my prototype in Adobe XD. And in my programming phase I coded the whole website 
          in React and added styled components as the styling of my website.

      <th>Design Prototype</th>
      <td> I used Adobe XD when I designed my prototype. I took my inspiration from Facebook and made my "/" page 
      my login page. Then I wanted the random list of posts to be on my home page. I also created a comment button
      so you could see the comments on each post. As the second column of my home page I added the searchbar
      so you could search the posts. On My Profile page you can find the banner, avatar, and a list of his/her 
      personal posts.

      I imported a background image for all of my pages. After trying forever to get this background image 
      to work in my code I decided to let it go. I changed background color several times under my project 
      so I decided to keep my bakground image for my prototype though this wouldn´t be my final result. 
      My header and nav bar also turned out different then my prototype. A lot of pages was added to this project
      little by little as weeks went by and I got some clarity about things. Since my prototype was buildt 
      before coding my page I don´t have all om my pages in my prototype. 

      2 weeks before delivery I realised I had forgotten to add a FOLLOWING page to my project.
      I didn´t had the time to make a prototype of it, or other pages that I made while coding, and 
      I also didn´t think it was that important to do so. I also discovered after a while that there 
      were 2 delete buttons in this project. One for removing comments, and the other one for removing 
      posts. In my protytype I just had one delete button that spelled DELETE.  
      
      In my nav bar I added a link so I could go to a Create Post page so you could easily and fast access, 
      write and publish your posts. I also put my Following page in my nav bar.

      <th>Style Guide</th>
      <td>I made my Style Guide in Illustrator. I made one page for the logo and my colour palette,
        one page for the typography and buttons, one page for form elements and image elements, one 
        page for columns and grids and the last page for interactive features and brand personalities 
        and target audiense.
        
        I also made my logo in Illustrator. 

        In my style guide the plan was that all of my pages should have a 2 column grid, but when I
        coded I was adviced to only have one API call per page. My exeption to this would be the page with 
        the search bar.

      <th>Kanban Board</th>
      <td> First I had to refresh my brain what a Kanban Board actually was. I had totally forgot. I found some 
        information I could use in Project Methodology module 1. Then it was off to the store to buy some 
        post-it notes. I bought one package of pink and one package of yellow post-it notes. That way it was 
        easier for me to spot the difference of what was pages and what was user stories. I began writing user stories 
        on my yellow post-it notes. One user story per yellow post-it notes. When I was finished writing my user 
        stories, I wrote all of my pages on pink post-it notes. Then I put all of my pink post-it notes on the table 
        and attached the user stories under each page. After reading and placing all my user stories I decided my 
        theme; Student contact. My target audience would be students. My feature would be "Getting in contact 
        via the website" and my epic would be "As a customer I can get in contact with my students via the website
        so I can read, comment or react on any posts or create a post on my own."  
        
        I also wrote my user stories as comments on the top of every page I created in VSC so I could keep track
        of everything. These comments I removed before delivery.

        One week before my project ended I decided to make a new Kanban board. Only this time with pages 
        and API calls instead of pages and user stories. I wrote all my 9 pages on pink sticker notes before I
        put it on the table. Then I wrote all my API calls on yellow sticker notes with the name of my function 
        below the url. 

        In the end I visited the page "https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v1/social/posts" and  
        "https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v1/social/profiles" to make sure that my API calls were correct.
        After putting all my yellow sticker notes under each page I descovered I had forgot a page. 
        I didn´t create the FOLLOWING page. I also discovered I had missed one delete button and that I 
        needed an api call for my searchbar.
